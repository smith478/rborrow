This is partial code.  Pieces are missing, as explained in more detail below.  It's intended to showcase some of our ideas.

This is some code designed to scrape data and process data from the Reddit lending platform r/borrow.  More details about the project are here: https://sites.google.com/view/rborrow/home

Files available in this repo:
- main_scraper.py: This is the file that repeatedly looks for new posts, processes, and send out email notifications about them.
- helpers/custombst.py: This is the modified BST that we used to make our data quickly searchable.
- helpers/*: These are various parsing libraries to help with scraping data

Files not available:
- Historical scraper: To build our model we made some code to scrape data going back in time.
- Model: We ran new posts through a model we had trained on historical data.  Here instead, we have a placeholder modelon.R that always returns 100%.
- Clustering logic: We use clusters of subreddits, stored in data/srs_tabs.csv, but we don't include the code used to make these.
